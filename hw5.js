//Q + A
//How do we assign a value to a variable?
        //To assign a variable use var(global affect out of scope), let (affects in the scope),
        //const stays const in the scope it is assigned cannot be changed.

        //How do we change the value of a variable?
        // by declare it var something; let something; const something;

//How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
        //by define it like var something = {}; or let something = {}; const something = {}

//Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
        //declaration //var carName// variable has no value
        //assigning a value to car like number color ect
        //defining a variable needs an assignment operators like =

//What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
        //helps plan out code and able to to give a outline of the problem most important!

//What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're 
//going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
        //programming is 75-90% planning and 10-25% of actual typing!
